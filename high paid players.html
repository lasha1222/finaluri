						<h6>Stephen Curry</h6>
						<h5 style="color: yellow;">High paid player</h5>
					</div>
					<div style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">
					Stephen Curry has long been considered one of the NBA's top players. He has been named regular season MVP twice and one of those times, in 2016, he became the league's first unanimous MVP winner in history. Curry has also led the Golden State Warriors to the NBA Finals four years in a row and helped them win two championships.

But it wasn't until last year that Curry's salary caught up with his status.

For the 2016-2017 season, Curry earned $12.1 million, finishing up the $44 million contract he signed with the Warriors in 2012. It was a massive bargain for Oakland; in comparison, teammate Kevin Durant earned $26.5 million the same season.

When Curry renewed his contract last July, he signed on for a whopping $201 million over five years, earning him a gross payout of around $34 million for the 2017-2018 season alone.

That boost in salary propelled Curry from the 74th spot on the list of highest-paid players to the first, surpassing both Durant and rival LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Although James still rakes in more per year when endorsements are included, Curry is earning the highest salary in the NBA.

				</div>
				<br>
					<div style="color: white; font-size: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">
					LeBron James is the latest NBA legend to join the Los Angeles Lakers and his new contract will take him past some other Lakers legends when it comes to the highest on-court earnings in basketball history.

Through the end of the 2017-18 season, LeBron was already the sixth-highest-paid player in NBA history, with $233.9 million in career earnings. But with his new 4-year, $153.3 million deal with the Lakers, James will pass all five players ahead of him, including Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal, and the current leader, Kevin Garnett.

But LeBron is not the only active player shooting up the list. With the recent surge in contract sizes, several other players will soon surpass $250 million in career earnings, including a few names that might surprise many fans.

						<h6>Russel Westbrook</h6>

					<div style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">
					2018-2019 Salary: $28.5 million
On-par with Conley, Westbrook makes almost a cool $30 million playing for Oklahoma City Thunder.

Westbrook is locked into a 3-year, $85.6 million contract, reaching a salary cap of $30.5 million in his final year of 2018-2019. The 29-year-old point guard has an upcoming contract of 5 years, where the player could receive an average salary of up to $41 million.
